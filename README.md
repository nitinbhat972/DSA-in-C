## Introduction

This repository is a collection of C programs that demonstrate the implementation of common data structures and algorithms. Whether you're a beginner looking to understand the basics or an experienced developer wanting to refresh your knowledge, this repository can be a valuable resource.

## Features

- **Well-documented Code:** Each implementation is thoroughly documented, providing explanations of the data structure or algorithm, time and space complexities, and example usage.

- **Extensive Collection:** The repository includes a wide range of data structures (e.g., arrays, linked lists, trees) and algorithms (e.g., sorting, searching, graph algorithms).

- **Easy-to-Understand:** The code is written with readability in mind. Even complex algorithms are explained in a step-by-step manner.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/DSA-in-C.git
    cd DSA-in-C
    ```

2. Navigate to the specific data structure or algorithm folder.

3. Compile and run the C program:

    ```bash
    gcc filename.c -o output
    ./output
    ```

4. Explore and learn from the code.
